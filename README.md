## Quick Start

The project's structure look similar to this:

```
cineview

│   ├── components
│   ├── config
│   ├── i18n
│   ├── models
│   ├── navigators
│   ├── screens
│   ├── services
│   ├── theme
│   ├── utils
│   └── app.tsx
├── assets
│   ├── icons
│   └── images
├── test
│   ├── __snapshots__
│   ├── mockFile.ts
│   └── setup.ts
├── README.md
├── index.js
├── .env
├── .env.example
└── package.json

```

### ./app directory

Included in an Ignite boilerplate project is the `app` directory. This is a directory you would normally have to create when using vanilla React Native.

The inside of the `app` directory looks similar to the following:

```
app
├── components
├── config
├── i18n
├── models
├── navigators
├── screens
├── services
├── theme
├── utils
└── app.tsx
```

**components**
This is where your reusable components live which help you build your screens.

**i18n**
This is where your translations will live if you are using `react-native-i18n`.

**models**
This is where your app's models will live. Each model has a directory which will contain the `mobx-state-tree` model file, test file, and any other supporting files like actions, types, etc.

**navigators**
This is where your `react-navigation` navigators will live.

**screens**
This is where your screen components will live. A screen is a React component which will take up the entire screen and be part of the navigation hierarchy. Each screen will have a directory containing the `.tsx` file, along with any assets or other helper files.

**services**
Any services that interface with the outside world will live here (think REST APIs, Push Notifications, etc.).

**theme**
Here lives the theme for your application, including spacing, colors, and typography.

**utils**
This is a great place to put miscellaneous helpers and utilities. Things like date helpers, formatters, etc. are often found here. However, it should only be used for things that are truly shared across your application. If a helper or utility is only used by a specific component or model, consider co-locating your helper with that component or model.

**app.tsx** This is the entry point to your app. This is where you will find the main App component which renders the rest of the application.

### ./assets directory

This directory is designed to organize and store various assets, making it easy for you to manage and use them in your application. The assets are further categorized into subdirectories, including `icons` and `images`:

```
assets
├── icons
└── images
```

### ./test directory

This directory will hold your Jest configs and mocks.

## Questions:

### What does the single responsibility principle consist of? What's its purpose?

the principle is that each module or portion of the code should be dedicated exclusively to a responsibility

for example, if we have a Math module, it will only be dedicated to questions concerning mathematical problems, since this is its responsibility.

and it should not do anything else, for example to do json parsing.

### What characteristics does, in your opinion, a “good” code or clean code have?

For me a good code is one that is simple to understand.

a code that is written to be read by a human being in a quick way.

a code that is abstract enough (in a good way), to be able to know what it does without having to see the detail.

then this detail should be easily accessible if necessary, but it should not be

### Detail how you would do everything that you have not completed.

I would fix the TypeScript errors, add more robust testing with end-to-end tests, and it would be easy to achieve 100% code coverage, although that wouldn’t be necessary.

I would remove libraries that are no longer being maintained and implement my own version.

I would significantly improve the design and set up an automated deployment process.
